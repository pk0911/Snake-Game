# Snake-Game

## Introduction

One of the most popular and enjoyable games is the snake game. Nearly everyone has played it at least once in their lives. It features a snake and a fruit placed at a random location. The snake initially has a little body, but as it consumes fruit, its length increases and the game becomes more challenging. 

## Objective

In this project, I have built a snake game by using various concepts and modules of Python language. The player in this game must manipulate a snake till it touches the fruit. The game is over if the snake reaches either the edge of the screen or itself. 

## Python modules 

The three key modules used in developing this game are:

1. Turtle module: Turtle is a Python module that offers a capability similar to a drawing board, allowing users to create pictures and shapes.

2. Random module: The pseudo-random variables are produced using the built-in random module. It can be used to do random actions like generating a random          number, choosing random items from a list, randomly shuffling items, etc. 

3. Time module: The Python time module offers a variety of coded representations for time, including objects, integers, and strings. Along with functions other    than time representation, it also allows users to measure the effectiveness of their code and wait while it executes.
